title: First Blog

this is my first blog

however I don't know what to write down
This project is to write down my learning experiences, including knowledges and problems occurred.
As a programmer, I will mainly upload contents about programming, and some of my habits like language and music as well,
and also you might find some game skills and sharing like Genshin and so on.

As a junior in NUIST, next term we will have lectures on Algoritm, Compile Theory, AI, C#, Web, J2EE Framework(like spring...) and other.
That's a big challenge, thus I will be more concentrated!!!

I will be learning grammar of MARKDOWN to make my blog more easy and joyful to read, just expect that!

Thanks for you time.
